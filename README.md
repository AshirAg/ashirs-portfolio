# ashirs-portfolio
A sleek and modern looking, social media themed portfolio.

My personal portfolio website built with React &amp; PHP. Showcasing projects, education, skills, and contact info. Keeping UI/UX simple and modern looks. Custom code, no templates used.

ðŸ“ƒPAGES:
- Home
- Projects
- Contact

(There is no About page, because of the the Home page being there as About page)
